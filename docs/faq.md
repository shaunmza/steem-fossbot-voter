Common questions and issues with Voter.

## No posts are processed any more

If the first ```MAX_POST_TO_READ``` number of posts (set in your config) are less than ```MIN_POST_AGE_TO_CONSIDER``` minutes old then no posts will be considered for voting.

Due to the increased activity on Steem, this is entirely possible especially if the old default value for MAX_POST_TO_READ is used, which was 100. You should set this to 400, as is the current default, or even higher if Steem gets more popular. 

Please see [issue #78](https://github.com/Steem-FOSSbot/steem-fossbot-voter/issues/78) for more information.
